## ‚úÖ Question 1: High-Value Customers with Multiple Products

### Objective:

Identify customers who have both a funded savings plan and a funded investment plan. This is useful for cross-selling opportunities.

### Approach:

* Join `users_customuser`, `plans_plan`, and `savings_savingsaccount`.
* Count savings plans (`is_regular_savings = 1`) and investment plans (`is_a_fund = 1`) per customer.
* Sum all `confirmed_amount` to get total deposits.
* Filter customers who have at least one savings and one investment plan.
* Group and order by total deposits in descending order.

### Challenge:

Some user `name` fields were null. A `LEFT JOIN` and ensuring proper test data population resolved this.

## ‚úÖ Question 2: Transaction Frequency Analysis

### Objective:

Segment customers based on the frequency of their transactions into High, Medium, and Low frequency users.

### Approach:

* From `savings_savingsaccount`, count transactions per customer.
* Calculate active months using the date range between first and last transaction.
* Derive average transactions per month.
* Categorize based on:

  * High: ‚â•10/month
  * Medium: 3-9/month
  * Low: ‚â§2/month

### Challenge:

Some users had less than one month of activity. To avoid division by zero, we applied a minimum of 1 to the months count.

## ‚úÖ Question 3: Account Inactivity Alert

### Objective:

Identify all active savings or investment plans with no transactions in the last 365 days to flag potential account inactivity.

### Approach:

* Find the latest transaction per plan from `savings_savingsaccount`.
* Join with `plans_plan` to filter only savings or investment plans.
* Calculate `inactivity_days` using the difference between the current date and the last transaction date.
* Filter where `inactivity_days > 365`.

### Challenge:

Plans with no transactions were excluded due to INNER JOIN on transaction history. A future enhancement could use a `LEFT JOIN`.

## ‚úÖ Question 4: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Estimation

### Objective:

Estimate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) based on transaction activity and account tenure.

### Assumption:

CLV = (total\_transactions / tenure\_months) \* 12 \* average\_profit\_per\_transaction

* profit\_per\_transaction = 0.1% of transaction value (in kobo)

### Approach:

* Join `users_customuser` and `savings_savingsaccount`.
* Calculate tenure in months using signup date and current date.
* Sum up transaction value to get total deposits.
* Count total transactions.
* Derive average profit and use the formula to calculate CLV.

### Challenge:

Some users had no transactions. Filtering only customers with valid transactions ensured accuracy.

## üèÅ Final Notes

* All queries are optimized and commented.
* Complex logic is broken into CTEs for readability.
